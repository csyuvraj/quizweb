Simple Quiz App
A basic quiz application to test your knowledge, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What it does
This app gives you a series of questions. You pick an answer for each one, and the app keeps track of your score. Once you're finished, it shows you your final score so you can see how well you did. It's a great way to have fun and learn a bit of front-end development at the same time.

Getting started
You don't need to install anything to run this project. Just open the index.html file in your web browser, and you're all set!
